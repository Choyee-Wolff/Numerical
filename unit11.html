									<p>R code data activity result <a href="last_Data-Activities.html" class="title">Click  here</a></p>
									<p>I feel genuinely proud of myself for successfully completing all the R coding data activities. At the beginning, I wasn’t entirely confident in my coding skills, especially when working with real datasets. However, as I progressed through each activity, I began to see clear improvements in my understanding and my ability to apply R techniques to solve practical data problems.

										Throughout the process, I learned a wide range of skills – from basic data manipulation with dplyr and tidyr, to visualising data with ggplot2, and even performing more advanced analyses. Each activity challenged me in a different way, and I appreciated how they built on one another to gradually increase the level of complexity. It pushed me to think critically and develop problem-solving strategies, rather than just following instructions.
										
										What made this experience even more rewarding was the sense of achievement I felt after finishing each task. It wasn’t always easy – there were moments when I got stuck or made mistakes – but working through those challenges helped reinforce my learning. I now feel much more confident in using R as a tool for data analysis, and I’m excited to use these skills in future projects.
										
										Looking back, I realise how much I’ve grown during this period. These R code data activities were not only educational but also enjoyable. I had fun exploring different datasets, discovering patterns, and seeing the results of my work visualised in graphs and summaries. This hands-on approach to learning data science has deepened my interest in the field, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to have completed it.</p>
