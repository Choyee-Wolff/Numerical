									<h3>Maths Test</h3>
									<p>I have experience using Excel, and to prepare for the test, I studied thoroughly and attended the seminar. I also went back to review all the books and made sure I covered everything. I rewatched the recorded sessions to reinforce my understanding, which made me feel quite confident going into the test.
										</p>
									<p>The test lasted 90 minutes and consisted of 5 questions, meaning I had roughly 18 minutes per question. I tried to manage my time well, aiming to spend no more than 15 minutes on each if possible.</p>
									<p>Although I always feel nervous before a test, I was relieved to see that the questions were familiar—very similar to what I had revised and what was covered in the lectures. The test went very well, and I’m proud to say I achieved 88%. I'm proud of myself, and it feels good to see that my hard work truly paid off.
